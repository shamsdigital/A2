               The Sales team at Bob Rohrman Kia had no shortage of opportunities Leads were coming in from multiple channels at all times of the day and
               night, with more than 45% originating during off-hours.
               
               With rapidly growing lead volume, the sales team was stretched to its limit. Responding to every inbound inquiry while trying to nurture customer
               relationships was becoming increasingly difficult, Too much time was being spent answering basic questions and chasing unresponsive leads,
               preventing sales reps from focusing on closing deals.
